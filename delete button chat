create a delete button somewhere on the transcript storage page to delete the entry entirely, make sure to double-check with the user that deleting is what they want to do, and make sure the user knows there is no getting it backâit is permanent. Remind them they could edit it if they want to, but if they delete it, it will be gone. If they choose to delete, remove the whole row from the database.

Thinking:The user wants me to create a delete button on the TranscriptStorage page that: 1. Confirms with the user that they want to delete (double-check) 2. Warns them it's permanent and there's no getting it back 3. Reminds them they could edit it instead 4. If they confirm, delete the whole row from the database I need to: 1. First examine the current TranscriptStorage page to understand its structure 2. Look at the transcript types and services to understand how deletion should work 3. Add a delete button with proper confirmation dialog 4. Implement the delete functionality in the service Let me start by examining the current TranscriptStorage page.‎

I'll help you add a delete button to the transcript storage page with proper confirmation. Let me first examine the current page structure and related files.

Thinking:Now I need to understand the TranscriptForm component and how the data flows. I can see the main page has form controls and handles saving, but I need to see how the actual form is structured to add a delete button appropriately. Let me also check the transcript service to understand how deletions would work.‎

Make sure the UI updates after deletion First, let me check the hooks to understand how data is managed and what services are available for deleting transcripts.‎

Now let me examine the transcript service and hooks to understand how the data is managed:

Thinking:Now I need to understand the current structure and implement a delete button with proper confirmation. Let me look at the transcript types to see the data structure: From what I can see: 1. The TranscriptStorage page has form management through useTranscriptForm hook 2. The TranscriptService already has a deleteTranscript method 3. I need to add a delete button with proper confirmation dialog 4. The delete should be permanent with no recovery option I should examine the types to understand the data structure and then add the delete functionality to the appropriate components.‎

Thinking:Now I understand the structure. I need to add a delete button to the TranscriptStorage page. From my analysis: 1. The TranscriptStorage page shows a form with transcript data 2. The TranscriptService already has a `deleteTranscript` method that can delete a transcript by date 3. I need to add a delete button that: - Shows a confirmation dialog explaining the consequences - Reminds the user they could edit instead of delete - Warns that deletion is permanent with no recovery - Actually deletes from the database if confirmed - Handles the UI state after deletion I should: 1. Add a delete button to the TranscriptForm component 2. Create a confirmation dialog component (or use existing alert-dialog) 3. Update the useTranscriptForm hook to handle deletion 4. Update the types if needed Let me start by updating the TranscriptForm component to add the delete button, then create the confirmation logic.‎

Now I'll add a delete button with proper confirmation to the transcript storage page. I'll need to:

1. Add a delete button to the TranscriptForm component
2. Create a confirmation dialog
3. Update the useTranscriptForm hook to handle deletion
4. Update the types as needed

Let me start by updating the TranscriptForm component:
