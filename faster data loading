Thinking:The user is mentioning that it's taking too long to load forms from Supabase and that it shouldn't start from scratch every time. They want me to help them think of a better way to do this. Looking at the environment, I can see this is a React dashboard application with Supabase integration. There are files like `src/lib/supabase.ts`, and I can see ActionItemsSection and NotesSection components in the open tabs. I should first examine the current implementation to understand how they're currently loading data from Supabase, and then suggest better approaches like caching, optimistic updates, etc. Let me start by examining the current Supabase setup and the ActionItemsSection component to understand the current data loading pattern.‎

I'll help you optimize the Supabase data loading performance. First, let me examine the current implementation to understand how data is being loaded.

Thinking:I need to understand the current structure of the application and how it's currently using Supabase for data loading. Let me first examine the package.json to see if Supabase and TanStack Query are installed, then look at the pillar layout and other components to understand the current data loading patterns.‎

Thinking:Let me analyze what I've seen so far and understand the current state of the application: 1. The application has Supabase set up (`@supabase/supabase-js` in package.json, and a basic supabase client in `/src/lib/supabase.ts`) 2. There's TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) installed, which is great for caching and data management 3. The ActionItemsSection and NotesSection components appear to be using local state and props currently, not directly using Supabase 4. The user is complaining about slow loading from Supabase and that it starts from scratch every time The issues I can identify: 1. No caching mechanism in place for Supabase data 2. No optimistic updates 3. No background refetching/synchronization 4. Likely fetching data on every component mount instead of having a centralized data layer I should look for how data is currently being fetched and where Supabase is being used, then propose a solution that includes: 1. TanStack Query for caching and optimistic updates 2. Background synchronization 3. Local storage as a fallback 4. Proper error handling and retry logic Let me check some more files to understand the current data flow.‎

Thinking:I need to understand what the user is asking about. They mentioned "it should not be taking that long to load from Supabase, also it shouldn't start from scratch every time". Looking at the code I've read so far: 1. I see there's a `src/lib/supabase.ts` file that creates a basic Supabase client 2. The `ActionItemsSection.tsx` and `NotesSection.tsx` components seem to be using some Supabase functionality (based on the `onAddNote` async function in NotesSection) 3. I searched for "supabase" in the codebase but found 0 results, which is strange given that there's a supabase.ts file Let me search more broadly to understand how data is being loaded and where the performance issues might be.‎

Thinking:The user is asking about optimizing the Supabase data loading performance. They mentioned that it's taking too long to load from Supabase and that it shouldn't start from scratch every time. From what I've seen so far: 1. I've examined the basic Supabase setup in `src/lib/supabase.ts` - it's a standard client setup 2. The ActionItemsSection and NotesSection components are mostly working with local state and mock data 3. The package.json shows they have @supabase/supabase-js and @tanstack/react-query installed 4. My searches for "supabase" and other loading-related terms didn't find results, which suggests the actual Supabase integration might not be fully implemented yet or is in different files Let me look at some key files that might contain the data loading logic: - Check the hooks directory for data fetching - Look at the pages to see how data is being loaded - Check the data directory for any Supabase integration‎

Thinking:Now I can see the issue! Looking at the code, I can see that: 1. The app is using Supabase for data persistence 2. It's using TanStack Query for data fetching and caching 3. The `usePillarData.ts` hook is making separate queries for: - Meeting notes for today - Meeting notes for yesterday - Action items for today - Action items for yesterday The problem is that every time the user changes the selected date or navigates to a different pillar, it's making fresh API calls to Supabase, and there's no persistent caching between sessions. Here are the main performance issues I can identify: 1. **No persistent caching**: TanStack Query cache is lost on page refresh 2. **Multiple separate queries**: 4 separate queries per pillar/date combination 3. **No background refetching optimization**: Queries might be refetching too aggressively 4. **No prefetching**: Not loading data for likely next dates/pillars 5. **Real-time subscriptions creating excessive invalidations**: The real-time listeners invalidate queries on every change Let me create a better solution that addresses these issues: 1. Add persistent caching with localStorage/indexedDB 2. Implement intelligent prefetching 3. Optimize query invalidation strategy 4. Add background sync for better UX 5. Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern‎

I can see the performance issues with your Supabase data loading. The current implementation is making fresh API calls every time and has no persistent caching. Let me create an optimized solution that includes:

1. __Persistent caching__ - Data survives page refreshes
2. __Smart prefetching__ - Load likely next dates in background
3. __Optimized invalidation__ - Reduce unnecessary refetches
4. __Stale-while-revalidate__ - Show cached data immediately while updating in background

ThinkingThe user has asked for help optimizing Supabase data loading performance. I've analyzed the code and can see the current implementation has several performance issues: 1. No persistent caching - data is refetched on every page refresh/component mount 2. Making separate queries for current and yesterday's data 3. No background prefetching of likely-to-be-accessed data 4. Real-time subscriptions causing unnecessary invalidations I need to provide a solution that implements: 1. Persistent caching using React Query's built-in persistence 2. Smart prefetching strategies 3. Optimized query keys and invalidation patterns 4. Stale-while-revalidate patterns Let me create an optimized version of the usePillarData hook.

ThinkingI need to fix the TypeScript errors in the optimized hook. The errors are on lines 232 and 306 where I'm using spread types that may only be created from object types. Let me look at those lines and fix them. Line 232 is in the createNoteMutation onMutate function: ```typescript const updatedData = { ...previousData } ``` Line 306 is in the createItemMutation onMutate function: ```typescript const updatedData = { ...previousData } ``` The issue is that `previousData` might be undefined or not an object type. I need to add proper type checking before using the spread operator.
