> how does the last recoded meeting notes logic work

● I'll help you understand how the last recorded meeting notes
  logic works. Let me search for the relevant code.

         "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}")

● The last recorded meeting notes logic works through several
  layers:

  Core Logic Flow

  1. Data Fetching (usePillarDataOptimized.ts:143-166):
  - Queries Supabase for the most recent meeting note from before
  yesterday
  - Uses SQL filter .lt('note_date', yesterdayString) to exclude
  future notes
  - Orders by date descending and takes the first result

  2. Display Logic (useNotesDisplayLogic.ts):
  - Shows last recorded notes only when:
    - Yesterday has no meaningful content (!yesterdayHasContent)
    - Last recorded note has valid content (lastRecordedHasContent)

    - Last recorded date is actually older than yesterday
  (isValidLastRecorded)

  3. Content Validation (useNotesDisplayLogic.ts:51-66):
  - Checks both key_points string and keyPoints array
  - Validates non-empty, non-whitespace content
  - Prevents display of empty notes

  4. UI Display (YesterdayNotesSection.tsx):
  - Shows with dimmed styling (opacity-75)
  - Includes tooltip explaining edit restrictions
  - Falls back gracefully when no notes exist

  The system ensures users only see relevant historical notes when
  current data is missing, with proper date validation and content
  filtering.

> deep think about the best way to implemenet the same logic to the
   action itmes. so that if there are no yesterdays action items it
   will show the last reocded ones. following the same logic that 
  the meeting notes do.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to implement the same logic for action items 
  that currently exists for meeting notes. Let me analyze the 
  current meeting notes logic and then plan how to apply it to 
  action items.

  Current Meeting Notes Logic:
  1. Data Fetching: In usePillarDataOptimized.ts, there's a query 
  for lastRecordedNote that gets the most recent meeting note from 
  before yesterday
  2. Display Logic: In useNotesDisplayLogic.ts, there's centralized
   logic that determines when to show yesterday's notes vs last 
  recorded notes
  3. UI Components: YesterdayNotesSection.tsx displays the notes 
  with appropriate styling and tooltips

  For Action Items, I need to:
  1. Add data fetching for last recorded action items (similar to 
  lastRecordedNote query)
  2. Create or extend display logic for action items (similar to 
  useNotesDisplayLogic)
  3. Update UI components to show last recorded action items when 
  yesterday's are empty

  Let me look at the current action items structure first to 
  understand what exists.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze current action items structure and components       
     ☐ Add lastRecordedActionItems query to usePillarDataOptimized
     ☐ Create or extend display logic for action items (similar to
       useNotesDisplayLogic)
     ☐ Update ActionItemsSection components to show last recorded
       when yesterday is empty
     ☐ Test the implementation and ensure consistency with notes
       logic

✻ Thinking…

  Let me analyze the current action items structure first to 
  understand what components and logic already exist.

● Search(pattern: "ActionItem|action.*item", glob: "**/*.{ts,tsx}")
  ⎿  Found 15 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me read the key action items components to understand the 
  current structure.

● Read(src/components/dashboard/ActionItemsSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 221 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/components/dashboard/YesterdayActionItemsSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 156 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/components/dashboard/ActionItemsAndNotesSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 83 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand the current structure. Let me analyze what I 
  need to implement:

  Current Action Items Structure:
  1. ActionItemsSection.tsx - Shows current action items and 
  yesterday's action items in one component
  2. YesterdayActionItemsSection.tsx - Dedicated component for 
  yesterday's action items (table format)
  3. ActionItemsAndNotesSection.tsx - Combines action items and 
  notes sections

  Current Approach vs Meeting Notes:
  - Meeting notes have separate components for yesterday vs last 
  recorded
  - Meeting notes use useNotesDisplayLogic to decide what to show
  - Action items currently just show yesterday's items in the same 
  component

  What I need to implement:
  1. Add lastRecordedActionItems query to usePillarDataOptimized.ts
   
  2. Create display logic for action items (similar to 
  useNotesDisplayLogic) 
  3. Update components to show last recorded action items when 
  yesterday is empty

  Let me complete the first todo by marking it as completed and 
  start the second one.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze current action items structure and components       
     ☐ Add lastRecordedActionItems query to usePillarDataOptimized
     ☐ Create or extend display logic for action items (similar to
       useNotesDisplayLogic)
     ☐ Update ActionItemsSection components to show last recorded
       when yesterday is empty
     ☐ Test the implementation and ensure consistency with notes
       logic

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me add the lastRecordedActionItems query to 
  usePillarDataOptimized.ts. I need to find where the yesterday 
  action items query is and add a similar one for last recorded 
  action items.

● Search(pattern: "yesterdayActionItems|yesterday.*action", glob:
        "**/usePillarDataOptimized.ts", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at the action items query in the hook to understand 
  how it's structured.

● Read(src/hooks/usePillarDataOptimized.ts)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to see if there's a fetchActionItemsForDateRange 
  function and understand its structure. Let me look for it and 
  also see how the hook returns action items.

● Search(pattern: "fetchActionItemsForDateRange", glob:
        "**/*.{ts,tsx}", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at the fetchActionItemsForDateRange function 
  implementation and also see the return statement of the hook to 
  understand how to add the lastRecordedActionItems.

● Read(src/hooks/usePillarDataOptimized.ts)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me find the return statement of the hook to see what I 
  need to add there.

● Read(src/hooks/usePillarDataOptimized.ts)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see the pattern. I need to add a 
  lastRecordedActionItems query similar to how lastRecordedNote is 
  implemented. Let me add this query after the lastRecordedNote 
  query.

● Read(src/hooks/usePillarDataOptimized.ts)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll add the lastRecordedActionItems query right after the 
  lastRecordedNote query. I'll follow the exact same pattern but 
  for action items.
